A small learning project - a simple forum.
I mainly wanted to try out how to connect Python (Flask) with SQL and a bit of HTML.
The focus is clearly on the backend. I didn’t spend much time on design – the main goal was to understand how databases, routes, and APIs work together. 
I might expand it in the future and explore more of the frontend (maybe with Vue), but for now I just wanted to get everything working and learn by doing.
